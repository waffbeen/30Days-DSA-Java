 Day 07 - 30 Days DSA Java Challenge

Today I solved two interesting **medium-level** problems from LeetCode using Java.

### Problems Solved:

1. 3Sum
   LeetCode Link: [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

2. Partition Labels
   LeetCode Link: [Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)
 What I Learned:

- 3Sum:
  Learned how to use two pointers along with sorting to reduce the time complexity from O(n³) to O(n²), while carefully avoiding duplicate triplets.

- Partition Labels:
  Understood how to use character last occurrence positions to dynamically partition the string so that each character only appears in one part.


Continuing the consistency, improving problem-solving skills step by step.
