# 30Days-DSA-Java

Welcome to the 30 Days Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge using Java.

In this repository, I am committing to solve one DSA problem daily using Java.  
The aim of this challenge is to:

- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Master important data structures and algorithms.
- Build consistency in daily practice.
- Prepare effectively for coding interviews.

## Challenge Structure

Each day will have its own folder containing the solution of that dayâ€™s problem.

Example:

## Example Problem Folders
Day1-TwoSum
Day2-ReverseString
Day3-ValidParentheses
...


The solution will be provided in Java language along with comments for better understanding.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local system.
2. Browse the folders by day.
3. Each folder will have the Java file containing the solution and it's snippet.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeStudio, GeeksforGeeks

## Purpose of this Challenge

This challenge is designed to make me disciplined and consistent in my learning journey, and to strengthen my fundamentals in data structures and algorithms.

By the end of this challenge, I will have a collection of problems solved in Java that I can showcase as part of my portfolio.

## About Me

I am passionate about improving my coding skills and this challenge is part of my journey towards becoming a better problem solver and a job-ready developer.
